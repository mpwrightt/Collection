# Overview — What It Is and Who It’s For

## Problem
Trading Card Game (TCG) players struggle to track collections, build legal decks quickly, and understand costs and gaps between what they own and what they need.

Collection Tracker is a modern web app to:
- Aggregate your owned cards and prices
- Search the catalog and add cards to decks or collections
- Build decks with AI that respect format rules
- Validate legality and estimate missing cost automatically

## Audience
- Casual and competitive players of MTG, Pokémon, and Yu‑Gi‑Oh!
- Collectors who want portfolio value insights
- Local game stores and communities running events

## Outcomes / Value
- Faster deck construction with legality confidence
- Clear view of owned vs. missing cards and estimated cost
- Streamlined inventory and deck management in one place
